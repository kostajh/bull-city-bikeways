<h1>Bull City Bikeways</h1>
<p>This is a map of bike routes used by folks in Durham, NC. All of the routes you see were entered by people like you - and we hope you'll add your route to the mix too!</p>
<h2>Add your routes</h2>
<p>Getting your routes on the map can be done in two simple steps. The whole process should take 5-15 minutes:</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="#">Draw your route</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1GOGYquX2hP55MGCaQf-BhVTw1EMj4lcSnITGjslYIuE/viewform" target="_blank">Submit your data</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Repeat this process for as many routes as you care to submit. Having trouble with this process? Please e-mail us and we'll see what we can do.</p>
<p>If your route is already on the map, but you need to make a change go to the <a href="https://github.com/kostajh/bull-city-bikeways/tree/master/data" target="_blank">data page</a> for the site, find your entry, and click "Edit" (you'll need to sign up for a free account at Github to do this). Or e-mail us with your requested changes.</p>
<h2>Use cases</h2>
<p>We think this map will be useful to you if:
  <ul>
    <li>you want to start cycling to work/school or for running errands but aren't sure about a good route to your destination</li>
    <li>you are already riding but are looking for a safer, alternate route</li>
    <li>you want to partner up with someone for your commute</li>
    <li>you're a transport planner who wants to know where people are cycling.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<h2>Compliments and criticism</h2>
<p>Your suggestions and critiques are most welcome. You can e-mail us, <a href="https://github.com/kostajh/bull-city-bikeways/issues">file an issue in the bug tracker</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/kostajh/bull-city-bikeways">make the change yourself</a> - the site and its data are free and open source.</p>
